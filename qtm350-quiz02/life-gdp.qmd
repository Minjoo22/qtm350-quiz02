## Introduction

This analysis explores the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita across different countries and years.

```{python}
# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

# dataset
gapminder = pd.read_csv('gapminder.csv')

# scatter plot
scatter = sns.scatterplot(
    data=gapminder,
    x="gdp_per_capita",
    y="life_expectancy",
    hue="continent",
    size="population_millions",
    sizes=(20, 500),
    alpha=0.7
)

plt.xscale('log')

plt.xlabel('GDP per Capita (log scale)')
plt.ylabel('Life Expectancy (years)')
plt.title('Life Expectancy vs. GDP per Capita (2007)')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Analysis

The scatter plot reveals a strong positive correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy. Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have longer life expectancies. The relationship appears to be logarithmic rather than linear, suggesting that increases in GDP have diminishing returns on life expectancy after a certain threshold.
